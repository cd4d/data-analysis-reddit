# Analysis: Reddit banned accounts 
In 2018 Reddit [banned 944 accounts](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/) on suspicion of interference by the Russian government.

A year later, it again [banned 61 accounts](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/e74nml), however this time the target of the suspicious accounts was the UK Election of December 2019.

In total 1,001 users were banned in these two banwaves.

The Python script scrapes the user accounts linked in these two posts in order to perform a simple data analysis in the jupyter Notebook.
